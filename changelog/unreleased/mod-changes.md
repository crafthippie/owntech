Change: Update list of installed mods

While playing this pack actively we found some mods which are not really used or
which are not that great as expected. With this version we remove
`Colored Lights`, `Attained Drops 2`, `Ore Excavation`, `RFTools Dimensions`,
`Water Strainer` and `WorldEditCUI Forge Edition 2`. To be able to place proper
lights we add `Simply Light`, this should not crash and you should be able to
remove these blocks.
