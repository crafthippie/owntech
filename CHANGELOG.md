## Details

 * Change #8: Update list of installed mods

   While playing this pack actively we found some mods which are not really used or which are not
   that great as expected. With this version we remove `Colored Lights`, `Attained Drops 2`, `Ore
   Excavation`, `RFTools Dimensions`, `Water Strainer` and `WorldEditCUI Forge Edition 2`. To
   be able to place proper lights we add `Simply Light`, this should not crash and you should be able
   to remove these blocks.

 * Change #9: Enable more metals

   To easily build patterns for Tinkers Construct we should enable Alumite and beside that also
   Platinum and Iridium.
