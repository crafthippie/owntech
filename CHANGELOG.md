 * Change #12: Drop Mystical Agriculture mod

   We are not using this mod at all, beside that it's simply not that great for the balancing, let's
   just get rid of it.

 * Change #8: Update list of installed mods

   While playing this pack actively we found some mods which are not really used or which are not
   that great as expected. With this version we remove `Colored Lights`, `Attained Drops 2`, `Ore
   Excavation`, `RFTools Dimensions`, `Water Strainer` and `WorldEditCUI Forge Edition 2`. To
   be able to place proper lights we add `Simply Light`, this should not crash and you should be able
   to remove these blocks.

 * Change #10: Upgrade mod to latest version

   Update the mods within the Twitch launcher and export the updated profile to get the latest
   compatible mod versions integrated into the pack.

 * Change #9: Enable more metals

   To easily build patterns for Tinkers Construct we should enable Alumite and beside that also
   Platinum and Iridium.

 * Change #11: Integrate NoMoreRecipeConflict mod

   We got conflicting recipes, for example between Thermal Expansion and Advanced Generators,
   with the addition of this mod we are able to craft all required items for both mods.
