## Details

 * Change #8: Update list of installed mods

   While playing this pack actively we found some mods which are not really used or
   which are not that great as expected. With this version we remove `Colored
   Lights`, `Attained Drops 2`, `Ore Excavation`, `RFTools Dimensions`, `Water
   Strainer` and `WorldEditCUI Forge Edition 2`. To be able to place proper lights
   we add `Simply Light`, this should not crash and you should be able to remove
   these blocks.

   To easily build patterns for Tinkers Construct we should enable Alumite and
   beside that also Platinum and Iridium.

   Update the mods within the Twitch launcher and export the updated profile to get

 * Change #11: Integrate NoMoreRecipeConflict mod

   We got conflicting recipes, for example between Thermal Expansion and Advanced
   Generators, with the addition of this mod we are able to craft all required
   items for both mods.

 * Change #12: Drop Mystical Agriculture mod

   We are not using this mod at all, beside that it's simply not that great for the
   balancing, let's just get rid of it.
